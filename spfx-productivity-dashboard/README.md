## Prerequisite to use this sample

- [Set up SharePoint Framework development environment](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-spfx-dev-environment-setup)（Recommend to use SPFx v1.17.4）
- A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps. You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)
- [Deploy the Microsoft Graph Toolkit SharePoint Framework package to your tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-web-part-microsoft-graph-toolkit?WT.mc_id=m365-80548-wmastyka#deploy-the-microsoft-graph-toolkit-sharepoint-framework-package)

## Minimal path to awesome

### Deploy the app

>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using TeamsFx CLI tool, refer to [Try sample with TeamsFx CLI](cli.md)

1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code, click `Provision` in LIFECYCLE panel of Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension or open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision`. This step will create an app in Teams App Studio.
1. Go back to Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension, click `Deploy` in LIFECYCLE panel or open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy`.
    > This step will build a SharePoint package (*.sppkg) under `sharepoint/solution` folder. The Teams Toolkit will automatically upload and deploy it to your tenant App Catalog site. Only tenant App Catalog site admin has permission to do it. If you are not the admin, you can create your test tenant following [Setup your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).
1. Go to your SharePoint Admin center. In the left-hand navigation, select `Advanced` and then `API Access`. You should see pending requests for each of the permissions requested in src\config\package-solution.json file. Select and approve each permission.

### Preview the app in Teams

1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the app. In Visual Studio Code, select target environment and click `Preview App` in ENVIRONMENT panel to open a browser.
